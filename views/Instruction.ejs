                        such information is often best presented in a tabular
                        format in which the groups are in adjacent columns<br>
                    <li> It should also be clear as to the retrospective or

                        name and location in parentheses), and procedures must
                        be identified in sufficient detail to allow other workers
                        to reproduce the study.<br>
                    <li> It is essential that the manner in which studies
                        were evaluated i.e. independent readings, consensus
                        readings, blinded or unblinded to other information,
                        time sequencing between readings of several studies
                        of the same patient or animal to eliminate recall bias,
                        random ordering of studies or otherwise be clearly defined
                        . <br>
                    <li> Give references to established methods, including
                        statistical methods that have been published but are
                        not well known; describe new or substantially modified
                        methods and give reasons for using these techniques.<br>
                    <li> Briefly state the statistical methods used to analyze
                        your data. It is strongly recommended that all authors
                        seek statistical consultation prior to planning a study
                        to ensure that collection of data and the statistical
                        tests to analyze those data are appropriate especially
                        in studies related to cost analysis or cost-effectiveness.

                    <li> Any exclusions or losses to follow-up that might
                        affect the study population are required to be stated<br>
                    <li> When tables are used, do not duplicate tabular data
                        in the text, but do describe important trends and points<br>
                    <li> Summarize only important observations, and do not
                        repeat in the text all the data in the tables and/or
                        illustrations. <br>
                    <li> Make sure to give results for all items evaluated
                        mentioned in Materials and Methods section<br>
                    <li> State the statistical significance of your findings.<br>
                    <li> Numerators and denominators must be provided either
                        in the text or the tables for all percentages given.
                        The same applies to sensitivity, specificity, accuracy,
                        and positive and negative predictive values. <br>
                    <li> When using subheadings in Materials and Methods,
                        it may be helpful to present the results in the same
                        sequence using the same subheadings. <br>

                        study and the conclusions that follow from them. <br>
                    <li> Detail data given in the results section should not
                        be repeated unless it used to compare with the results
                        of other studies.<br>
                    <li> The implications of the findings as well as their
                        limitations, in particular with reference to the use
                        of modified methods, statistical or otherwise should
                        be discussed.<br>
                    <li> Also link the conclusions with the objectives of
                        the study, but unqualified statements and conclusions
                        not supported entirely the data should be avoided. <br>
                    <li> In addition reporting on the results of any ongoing
                        investigations, not yet completed is not advised.<br>

                <p>The Biomedical Imaging and Intervention Journal endorses and conforms to
                    the following statements made by the International Committee of Medical
                    Journal Editors ("Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to
                    Biomedical Journals") -- February 2006: </p>
                <blockquote>"Public trust in the peer review process and the credibility of
                    published articles depend in part on how well conflict of interest is
                    handled during writing, peer review, and editorial decision making.
                    Conflict of interest exists when an author (or the author's
                    institution), reviewer, or editor has financial or personal
                    relationships that inappropriately influence (bias) his or her actions
                    (such relationships are also known as dual commitments, competing
                    interests, or competing loyalties). These relationships vary from those
                    with negligible potential to those with great potential to influence
                    judgment, and not all relationships represent true conflict of interest.
                    The potential for conflict of interest can exist whether or not an
                    individual believes that the relationship affects his or her scientific
                    judgment. Financial relationships (such as employment, consultancies,
                    stock ownership, honoraria, paid expert testimony) are the most easily
                    identifiable conflicts of interest and the most likely to undermine the
                    credibility of the journal, the authors, and of science itself. However,
                    conflicts can occur for other reasons, such as personal relationships,
                    academic competition, and intellectual passion."</blockquote>
                <blockquote>"Patients have a right to privacy that should not be infringed
                    without informed consent. Identifying information, including patients'
                    names, initials, or hospital numbers, should not be published in written
                    descriptions, photographs, and pedigrees unless the information is
                    essential for scientific purposes and the patient (or parent or
                    guardian) gives written informed consent for publication. Informed
                    consent for this purpose requires that a patient who is identifiable be
                    shown the manuscript to be published. Authors should identify
                    Individuals who provide writing assistance and disclose the funding
                    source for this assistance.

                    <br /><br />Identifying details should be omitted if they are not
                    essential. Complete anonymity is difficult to achieve, however, and
                    informed consent should be obtained if there is any doubt. For example,
                    masking the eye region in photographs of patients is inadequate
                    protection of anonymity. If identifying characteristics are altered to
                    protect anonymity, such as in genetic pedigrees, authors should provide
                    assurance that alterations do not distort scientific meaning and editors
                    should so note.

                    <br /><br />The requirement for informed consent should be included in
                    the journal's instructions for authors. When informed consent has been
                    obtained it should be indicated in the published article."</blockquote>
                <blockquote>"When reporting experiments on human subjects, authors should
                    indicate whether the procedures followed were in accordance with the
                    ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation
                    (institutional and national) and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975,
                    as revised in 2000 (5). If doubt exists whether the research was
                    conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration, the authors must
                    explain the rationale for their approach, and demonstrate that the
                    institutional review body explicitly approved the doubtful aspects of
                    the study. When reporting experiments on animals, authors should be
                    asked to indicate whether the institutional and national guide for the
                    care and use of laboratory animals was followed."</blockquote>
