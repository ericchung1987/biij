                    BIIJ terminates it, or until you provide notice to BIIJ of your decision to terminate it. Your rights
                    under the license will terminate automatically without notice to you if you fail to comply with any of
                    the
                    provisions of these Terms and Conditions. BIIJ reserves the right to suspend, discontinue or change a
                    Service, or its availability to you, at any time without notice. Upon termination of the license to a
                    Service,
                    you shall cease all use of the Service.</p>
                <p><em>No Assignment:</em> You may not assign your rights or obligations under these Terms and Conditions to

                <p><em>No Waiver: </em>Neither failure nor delay on the part of BIIJ to exercise or enforce any right,
                    remedy,
                    power or privilege hereunder nor course of dealing between the parties shall operate as a waiver
                    thereof, or of
                    the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. No part of these Terms and Conditions shall
                    be
                    deemed waived, and no breach consented to, unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed
                    by the
                    party claimed to have waived or consented. No waiver of any rights or consent to any breaches shall
                    constitute a
                    waiver of any other rights or consent to any other breach.</p>

                    subscription or
                    license agreement, the latter terms shall control.</p>
