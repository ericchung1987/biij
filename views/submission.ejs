                                            your data. It is strongly recommended that all authors
                                            seek statistical consultation prior to planning a study
                                            to ensure that collection of data and the statistical
                                            tests to analyze those data are appropriate especially
                                            in studies related to cost analysis or cost-effectiveness.

                                            of crosshatching are preferred), but any tints that are

                                            of a third dimension gives no further information.</li>

                                        "Public trust in the scientific process and the credibility of published articles 
                                        depend in part on how transparently an author’s relationships and activities, 
                                        directly or topically related to a work, are handled during the planning, 
                                        implementation, writing, peer review, editing, and publication of scientific work. 
                                        The potential for conflict of interest and bias exists when professional judgment 
                                        concerning a primary interest (such as patients’ welfare or the validity of research) 
                                        may be influenced by a secondary interest (such as financial gain). Perceptions of conflict 
                                        of interest are as important as actual conflicts of interest. Financial relationships 
                                        (such as employment, consultancies, stock ownership or options, honoraria, patents, and paid 
                                        expert testimony) are the most easily identifiable, the ones most often judged to represent 
                                        potential conflicts of interest and thus the most likely to undermine the credibility of the 
                                        journal, the authors, and science itself. Other interests may also represent or be perceived 
                                        as conflicts, such as personal relationships or rivalries, academic competition, and 
                                        intellectual beliefs"

                                        "Patients have a right to privacy that should not be violated without informed consent. 
                                        Identifying information, including names, initials, or hospital numbers, should not be 
                                        published in written descriptions, photographs, or pedigrees unless the information is 
                                        essential for scientific purposes and the patient (or parent or guardian) gives written 
                                        informed consent for publication. Informed consent for this purpose requires that an 
                                        identifiable patient be shown the manuscript to be published. Authors should disclose to 
                                        these patients whether any potential identifiable material might be available via the 
                                        Internet as well as in print after publication. Patient consent should be written and 
                                        archived with the journal, the authors, or both, as dictated by local regulations or laws. 
                                        Applicable laws vary from locale to locale, and journals should establish their own 
                                        policies with legal guidance. Since a journal that archives the consent will be aware of 
                                        patient identity, some journals may decide that patient confidentiality is better guarded 
                                        by having the author archive the consent and instead providing the journal with a written 
                                        statement that attests that they have received and archived written patient consent. 
                                        Nonessential identifying details should be omitted. Informed consent should be obtained if 
                                        there is any doubt that anonymity can be maintained. For example, masking the eye region in 
                                        photographs of patients is inadequate protection of anonymity. If identifying characteristics 
                                        are de-identified, authors should provide assurance, and editors should so note, that such 
                                        changes do not distort scientific meaning. The requirement for informed consent should be 
                                        included in the journal’s instructions for authors. When informed consent has been obtained, 
                                        it should be indicated in the published article."

                            If the Editor recommends Accept Submission, the manuscript is accepted for publication. The
                            paper will be sent
                            to the next stage, to be proofread by a professional copyeditor. The author will be sent an

                            of their manuscript with the required changes suggested by the reviewers. Only the Editor,
                            and not the external
                            reviewers, reviews the revised manuscript after the changes have been made by the authors.
                            Once the Editor is
                            satisfied with the final manuscript, the manuscript can be accepted and sent to be proofread
                            by the copyeditors.

                        <p>
                            If the Editor recommends Resubmit for Review, the recommendation is communicated to the
                            authors. The authors are
                            expected to revise their manuscripts in accordance with the changes recommended by the
                            reviewers and to submit
                            their revised manuscript in a timely manner. Once the revised manuscript is submitted, the
                            original reviewers
                            are contacted with a request to review the revised version of the manuscript. Along with
                            their review reports on
                            the revised manuscript, the reviewers make a recommendation which can be Accept Submission,
                            Revisions Required,
                            Resubmit for Review, or Decline Submission. The Editor can then make the final editorial
                            recommendation.

                        <p>
                            An appropriate acknowledgment email will be sent to the authors, acknowledging them the
                            outcome of the review
                            process.

                        <p>
                            The editorial workflow gives the Editors the authority in rejecting any manuscript because
                            of inappropriateness
                            of its subject, lack of quality, or incorrectness of its results. The Editor cannot assign
                            himself/herself as an
                            external reviewer of the manuscript. This is to ensure a high-quality, fair, and unbiased
                            peer-review process of
                            every manuscript submitted to the journal, since any manuscript must be recommended by two
                            or more external
                            reviewers along with the Editor in charge of the manuscript in order for it to be accepted
                            for publication in
                            the journal.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The peer-review process is double blinded, i.e., the reviewers do not know who the authors
                            of the manuscript
                            are, and vice versa. At the end of the year, a list of researchers who have performed the
                            peer-review process
                            for the journal manuscripts in the past year will be published in the website. Without the
                            significant
                            contributions made by these researchers, the publication of the journal would not be
                            possible.
